## These python script utilities and the documentaion was generated using the Chat-GPT o1-mini model.

### The query for the timestamp utility was initially:

``
write a python script that takes a json file with an array of elements which include a timestamp field and outputs a json array with the number of minutes between each element. Then add an element with fields indicating the first and last timestamp in the input array
``

...then refined with:

``
can you put the element with the first and last timestamp as the first element of the array
``

...and then:
``
could you add an input parameter for the first timestamp to start using and the script will skip and elements before that timestamp
``
...and then:
``
change the time difference element in the output array to be an element with the time difference and the ending timestamp used to calculate the time difference
and then:
``
move the element with the first and last timestamp out of the array and make a new element with first and last timestamps and the array with the difference in minutes
``
and finally:
``
can you redo fresh the content of your answer  using the code in the last example so I can use it as documentation for the script
``
the output which I used here.

### For the filter script and docs went through the same steps basically... pretty impressed and from first prompt to this repo was about 30 min with half the time setting this repo up.
